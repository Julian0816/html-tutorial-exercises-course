			A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the toruble of thinking for oneself, always a laborious business -A.A. Milene, If I
			May
		</blockquote>

		<p>Finally you can have some bullets to sumarize everythig, after all, new generations have these things in common:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Don't like to read long texts</li>
			<li>Have the spawn of attention of bird</li>
			<li>Skip long paragraphs straight to the bullet points</li>
		</ul>
